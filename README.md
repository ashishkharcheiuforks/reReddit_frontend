Single page app front end for my reddit clone, reReddit. This project uses
the following technologies:
 
- React
- create-react-app
- react-redux
- react-router
- react-bootstrap
- redux-thunk
- redux-persist


Unfortunately at this point this project is still very much in progress
and I do not have a demo deployed. If you have create-react-app installed you
can clone the project and run it locally with a demo version of
the current api backend which is also currently under development. To do this
just rename `.env_example` file to `.env` and start the development server:

```
$ mv .env_example .env
$ npm start
```

The code for the Django Rest Framework backend api is available at
[reReddit_backend](https://github.com/cdunn6754/reReddit_backend).
